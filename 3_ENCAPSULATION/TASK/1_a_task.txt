Advanced Task: Build a BankAccount Management System
✅ Requirements:
Create a class BankAccount with the following private properties:

_accountNumber (int)
_accountHolderName (String)
_balance (double)

Use:
Constructor to initialize accountNumber, accountHolderName, and starting balance.
Getter methods to access all properties.
Setter for accountHolderName only (allow changing the name).

Create methods:
deposit(double amount)
➤ Increase balance, only if amount > 0

withdraw(double amount)
➤ Decrease balance, only if sufficient balance exists

displayAccountInfo()
➤ Show account number, holder name, and balance.

Add another class BankSystem

Manages a list of BankAccount objects
Has methods to:
addAccount()
displayAllAccounts()
searchAccountByNumber(int accountNumber)

💡 Bonus Challenge:
Implement a named constructor BankAccount.empty() to create an account with default values.
Prevent direct access to private data from outside the class (enforce encapsulation).
