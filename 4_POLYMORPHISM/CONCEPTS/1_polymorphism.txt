 Poly means many and morph means forms. Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. 
 As humans, we have the ability to take on many forms. 
 We can be a student, a teacher, a parent, a friend, and so on. 
 Similarly, in object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.

 Polymorphism is the ability of a class method to behave differently based on the object that is calling it,

Polymorphism is a concept in which a method with the same name performs different actions in different classes, 
especially in subclasses of a parent class.

Imagine you have a function called makeSound().

When a Dog uses it, it barks.

When a Cat uses it, it meows.

When a Cow uses it, it moos.

Even though the function name is the same — makeSound() — the result is different for each animal.

👉 This is called polymorphism — same function name, but different behavior depending on the object.
