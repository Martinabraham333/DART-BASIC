🚖 Task: Taxi Booking System with Driver and Vehicle Profiles
🎯 Goal:
Design a Dart system to manage drivers and vehicles in a taxi company. The system should support different types of drivers (full-time, part-time), vehicle types, and keep booking history.

🏗️ Core Classes:
1. Person (Base class)
Properties: name, age, contactNumber

Method: displayProfile()

2. Driver (Inherits Person)
Properties: driverId, licenseNumber, experienceYears

Named constructor: Driver.fromMap(Map data)

Override displayProfile() with super.displayProfile() + more info

3. FullTimeDriver and PartTimeDriver (Inherit from Driver)
FullTimeDriver → additional property: monthlySalary

PartTimeDriver → additional property: hourlyRate

Override displayProfile() in each

4. Vehicle
Properties: vehicleNumber, brand, seatingCapacity

Constructor + Vehicle.fromMap(Map data)

Method: vehicleInfo()

5. Booking
Properties: bookingId, driver, vehicle, pickupLocation, dropLocation, fare

Constructor should receive instances of Driver and Vehicle

Method: showBookingSummary()

✅ Example Scenario:
Create:

A full-time driver named Ramesh

A part-time driver named John

A vehicle (Innova)

A vehicle (Auto-rickshaw)

Bookings involving both drivers with vehicles

Print summaries using showBookingSummary()
